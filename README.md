# Next.js 15 Duplicate Route Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a route is defined multiple times, leading to a runtime error.  The issue arises when the application's structure and routing configurations conflict, resulting in ambiguous route definitions.

**Problem:** The provided `index.js` file is structured in a way that unintentionally creates duplicate route definitions, resulting in the error:

`Error: Route "/" is already defined.`

**Solution:** The solution involves carefully reviewing your application's structure and file names to ensure there are no conflicting route definitions.  A common cause is having multiple files or directories that could potentially handle the root route ("/").

The solution file provides a correct application structure to avoid this error.
